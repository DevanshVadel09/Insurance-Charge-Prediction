This project uses machine learning to predict medical insurance charges based on customer demographics and health-related features. The dataset includes features like age, BMI, smoking status, region, and more.
A key focus of this project is handling missing data effectively before training the model. The model is built using TensorFlow (Keras) and demonstrates the full pipeline from raw data to deployment-ready prediction.
